LOADSETS
========

This git repository contains the loadsets for several of my radios. They
are organised by category, e.g. SFBA; the individual radios are stored as
the radio name. Radios currently active are:

  + FT817: my (US) Yaesu FT817ND
  + VX6R: my Yaesu VX6R HT
  + UV5R: my Baofeng UV5R HT

Frequencies may be named with a /V or /U, indicating VHF (2m) or UHF
(typically 70cm, but may also be 1.25m).

Most loadsets will include VHFCALL and UHFCALL: the national VHF/UHF
simplex calling frequencies.


Categories
----------

SFBA contains loadsets relevant to the San Francisco Bay Area;
priority is given to frequencies used in the East Bay. Particularly
notable:

  + WB6NDJ: Oakland Radio Communications association repeater
  + ORCASXn: ORCA simplex primary (n=1), alternate (n=2).
  + W6TP: San Francisco Telephone Pioneers repeater
  + W6BXN: a repeater active near Mariposa, CA (e.g. Yosemite)
  + NR7A: a repeater active near Lake Tahoe
  + WA6GG: a repeater in Twin Peaks, San Francisco
  + N6MVT: a repeater in downtown San Francisco
  + W6PW: a repeater near the VA hospital in San Francisco (near
    Golden Gate Park)

The handhelds are also loaded with some of the common railway
frequencies in the area.


Radio notes
-----------

FT-817: the radio is set to save power. Automatic poweroff (menu item
8) is set to 1 hour, the noise blanker is disabler, and the front
antenna is used for VHF and UHF bands.
